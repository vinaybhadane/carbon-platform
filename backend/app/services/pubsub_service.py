Google Cloud Pub/Sub event publishing service.

Publishes lightweight events when carbon insights are generated, enabling
downstream consumers (Cloud Functions, Dataflow, etc.) to react in real-time.

All publishes are fire-and-forget: failures are logged as warnings
and never propagate to the caller.
